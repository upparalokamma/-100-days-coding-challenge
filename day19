Today, I expanded my SQL knowledge with the following concepts:

Primary Key: Ensuring each record in a table is unique.
Foreign Key: Creating links between tables to maintain referential integrity.
Unique Key: Ensuring all values in a column are distinct.
Creating Tables: Defining table structures using SQL commands.
Insert Queries: Inserting single and multiple records into tables.
Selecting Data: Querying tables to retrieve specific data.
Joins: Explored different types of joins including:
Inner Join: Selecting records with matching values in both tables.
Left Outer Join: Selecting all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
Right Outer Join: Selecting all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
Cross Join: Producing the Cartesian product of two tables.
Comments in SQL: Using comments to document SQL code.
Relationships Between Tables: Understanding how foreign keys create relationships between tables.
Practical Exercises: Practiced queries by inserting data into student and branch tables.
Building a solid foundation in SQL is crucial for database management, and I'm excited to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. Stay tuned for more updates!
