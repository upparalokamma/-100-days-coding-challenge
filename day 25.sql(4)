Day 25/100: SQL Learning Journey – Mastering DCL Commands!

Continuing from yesterday, I explored deeper into Data Control Language (DCL) commands in SQL. These commands are crucial for database security and access management:

🔐 GRANT: I practiced granting various permissions to users, ensuring they can only perform actions they’re authorized to do.

❌ REVOKE: I also learned how to efficiently revoke permissions, maintaining tight control over who can access and modify data.

Security and user management are key aspects of any robust database system, and these DCL commands are powerful tools in achieving that.

  
  Here’s an example I worked on:

sql

GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON products TO analyst_role;
REVOKE UPDATE ON products FROM analyst_role;
