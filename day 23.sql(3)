Day 24/100 – SQL Learning Journey 🚀

Today's focus was on key SQL commands:

Delved into DML commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manipulate data effectively. 📝
Mastered the SELECT command for retrieving data, along with SELECT DISTINCT for eliminating duplicates. 🔍
Used SELECT TOP to limit results and ORDER BY to sort them. 📊
Applied logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for more complex data filtering. 🧠
Feeling more confident in my SQL skills! 💻✨ #SQL #DataAnalytics #LearningJourney
