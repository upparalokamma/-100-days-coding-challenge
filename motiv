"**A setback is a setup for a comeback.**"

Taking **gaps** or facing **setbacks** doesnâ€™t mean **giving up**â€”theyâ€™re essential parts of the journey toward growth and success ğŸŒ±. Sometimes, a break helps us **refocus** and come back even **stronger** ğŸ’ª, and setbacks offer lessons that propel us forward ğŸš€. True strength lies in the ability to keep moving, no matter how many pauses or challenges arise. Itâ€™s all part of the bigger pictureâ€”moving forward with renewed determination ğŸ”¥!
