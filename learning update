Day 27: Learning Update
Today, I explored the concept of traffic congestion and how machine learning can be used to predict it using real-time data. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of array methods in programming, which are essential for efficient data manipulation. Excited to keep building on this knowledge as part of my learning journey! #LearningJourney #MachineLearning #Programming #DataScience #TrafficPrediction
